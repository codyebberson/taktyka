### Developers

You can play the unminified source version by opening "dev.html" in your web browser.

Per the contest requirements, the entire game must be included in a single "index.html" file.

Taktyka uses [Google Closure](https://developers.google.com/closure/) to compile/compress/minify the JavaScript and CSS.  The Google Closure .jar files are included in the repo.  They require Java to run.

Run "build.sh" to invoke Google Closure and build the complete index.html file.  The build script is only tested on Linux.
