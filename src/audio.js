 * The length of a single "beat" in seconds.
 * One beat is approximately a 1/8th note.

 * @const {!number}
 */
var beatLength = 0.005;

/**
 * Array of notes.
 * 
 * Each note is comprised of three values:
 * 
 *   1) The first element is the "midi" value as defined by the MIDI tuning standard:
 *      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_tuning_standard
 *   2) The second value is the start time delta in "beats" (see beatLength).
 *      The "delta" is the relative time since the previous note start time.
 *   3) The third value is the duration in "beats".
 *   
 * The song itself is:
 *
 *     "Peer Gynt Suite No.3, Opus. 46"
 *     "Anitra's Dance"
 *     Edvard Grieg (1843 - 1907)
 *
 * Listen to the real performance here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcEnSITNaGM
 * 
 * The numeric values were loosely derived from a MIDI file as follows:
 *   1) Convert the MIDI file to JSON using Tone.js MidiConvert
 *      https://tonejs.github.io/MidiConvert/
 *   2) Values extracted from JSON
 *   3) Strip out percussion and "string ensemble"
 *   4) Times in seconds converted to "beats", as they compress better.
 *
 * Plus manual touch-up for clean loop.
